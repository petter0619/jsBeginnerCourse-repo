    <h1>Challenge 1 - Drink About Game</h1>
    <p>
        Drink About is a simple function that will check the age and return a drink 
        appropriate for your age. Create a function called whatCanIDrink. This function 
        should take in age as parameter. The function should do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If the age is less than 0, then it should return "Sorry. I can’t tell what drink because that age is incorrect!"
        </li>
        <li>
            If the age is less than 14, then it should return "Drink Toddy"
        </li>
        <li>
            If the age is less than 18, then it should return "Drink Coke"

        </li>
        <li>
            If the age is less than 21, then it should return "Drink Beer"
        </li>
        <li>
            If the age is less than 130, then it should return "Drink Whisky"
        </li>
        <li>
            Else return "Sorry. I can’t tell what drink because that age is incorrect!"
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>Enter your age in the box below...</p>
    <form class="drinkAbout" autocomplete="off">
        <input type="text" name="age" id="age" placeholder="E.g. 24" required>
        <button type="submit">What can I drink?</button>
    </form>

    <h1>Challenge 2 - FizzBuzz</h1>
    <p>
        FizzBuzz is a classic programming problem that is often asked as an interview 
        question. Create a function called fizzBuzz. This function should take in 
        number as a parameter. The function should do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, then return "FizzBuzz"
        </li>
        <li>
            If the number is divisible by 3, then return "Fizz"
        </li>
        <li>
            If the number is divisible by 5, then return "Buzz"
        </li>
        <li>
            Else just return the number
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Write a set of tests that pass in various values to the FizzBuzz function and 
        ensure that the function meets the above requirements. Make sure that you test 
        all different "types" of inputs that the function may receive.
    </p>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>Enter a number in the box below...</p>
    <form class="fizzBuzz" autocomplete="off">
        <input type="text" name="number" id="number" placeholder="E.g. 12" required>
        <button type="submit">FizzBuzz!</button>
    </form>
    <p id="fizzBuzzResult"></p>
