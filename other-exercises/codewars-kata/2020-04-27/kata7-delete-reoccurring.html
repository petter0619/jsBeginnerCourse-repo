    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p>
        Alice and Bob were on a holiday. Both of them took many 
        pictures of the places they've been, and now they want to 
        show Charlie their entire collection. However, Charlie doesn't 
        like this sessions, since the motive usually repeats. He isn't 
        fond of seeing the Eiffel tower 40 times. He tells them that he 
        will only sit during the session if they show the same motive 
        at most N times. Luckily, Alice and Bob are able to encode the 
        motive as a number. Can you help them to remove numbers such 
        that their list contains each number only up to N times, 
        without changing the order?
    </p>
    <h4>Task</h4>
    <p>
        Given a list lst and a number N, create a new list that 
        contains each number of lst at most N times without 
        reordering. For example if N = 2, and the input is 
        [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], you take [1,2,3,1,2], drop the next [1,2] 
        since this would lead to 1 and 2 being in the result 3 times, 
        and then take 3, which leads to [1,2,3,1,2,3].
    </p>
    <h4>Examples</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>deleteNth ([1,1,1,1],2) // return [1,1]</li>
        <li>deleteNth ([20,37,20,21],1) // return [20,37,21]</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>My definition:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Function input: An array of numbers (1) (lst) + the number 
            of times each value in the array may occur/reoccur (2) (N)
        </li>
        <li>
            Output: Remove the extra occurrences of any value that 
            appears more than N number of times (occurrence N+).
        </li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>

        // Own Solution

        const array1 = [1,1,1,1]; // Each item can only reoccur 2 times
        const array2 = [20,37,20,21]; // Each item can only occur 1 time

        function deleteNth(list, n) {
            // instanceCounter function
            function instanceCounter(tally, arrayItem) {
                tally[arrayItem] = (tally[arrayItem] || 0) + 1;
                return tally;
            }
            // Create copy of lst
            let listCopy = [...list];
            // Identify the values that need to be altered (tally array)
            const tallyArray = Object.entries(list.reduce(instanceCounter, {}));
            // Loop through tallyArray to find keys > N
            tallyArray.forEach(function(item) {
                // IF itemTally > n (allowed occurrences)
                if(item[1]>n) {
                    // for loop
                        // let i = item[1] (tally)
                        // while i > N
                        // i--
                    for (let i = item[1]; i > n; i--) {
                        // let lastIndex = listCopy.findLastIndex of item[0]
                        let lastIndex = listCopy.lastIndexOf(parseInt(item[0]));
                        // listCopy.splice( lastIndex, 1 )
                        listCopy.splice(lastIndex, 1);
                    }
                }
            });
            //return listCopy;
            return listCopy;
        }
    
        console.log(deleteNth(array1, 2));
        console.log(array1);
        console.log(deleteNth(array2, 1));
        console.log(array2);


        // Best Solutions

        function deleteNth2(arr,x){
            var obj = {}
            return arr.filter(function(number){
                obj[number] = obj[number] ? obj[number] + 1 : 1
                return obj[number] <= x
            })
        }
