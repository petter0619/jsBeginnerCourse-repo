    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p>
        Polycarpus works as a DJ in the best Berland nightclub, and he 
        often uses dubstep music in his performance. Recently, he has 
        decided to take a couple of old songs and make dubstep remixes 
        from them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's assume that a song consists of some number of words (that 
        don't contain WUB). To make the dubstep remix of this song, 
        Polycarpus inserts a certain number of words "WUB" before the 
        first word of the song (the number may be zero), after the last 
        word (the number may be zero), and between words (at least one 
        between any pair of neighbouring words), and then the boy glues 
        together all the words, including "WUB", in one string and plays 
        the song at the club.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, a song with words "I AM X" can transform into a 
        dubstep remix as "WUBWUBIWUBAMWUBWUBX" and cannot transform 
        into "WUBWUBIAMWUBX".
    </p>
    <p>
        Recently, Jonny has heard Polycarpus's new dubstep track, but 
        since he isn't into modern music, he decided to find out what 
        was the initial song that Polycarpus remixed. Help Jonny restore 
        the original song.
    </p>
    <h4>Input</h4>
    <p>
        The input consists of a single non-empty string, consisting 
        only of uppercase English letters, the string's length doesn't 
        exceed 200 characters
    </p>
    <h4>Output</h4>
    <p>
        Return the words of the initial song that Polycarpus used to 
        make a dubsteb remix. Separate the words with a space.
    </p>
    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Input: "WUBWEWUBAREWUBWUBTHEWUBCHAMPIONSWUBMYWUBFRIENDWUB"</li>

            return song.replace(/(WUB)+/g," ").trim(); // .trim() removes whitespace from both ends of a string
